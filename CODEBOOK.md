Variables:

Variables includes subject, which informs the number of the subject of the research and activity, which informs the activity the subject was performing during the measurements. Other variables are average values of mean and std values of measurements of each subject and of each variable. Mean and std variables of measurementes were presented in features_info.txt file in original data.
